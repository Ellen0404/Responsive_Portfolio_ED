                        in Italy and now living in the United States) I have lived in 3 different countries, dived into 3
                        totally different cultures, and tried to get along with 3 different languages. Not easy, but always
                        interesting and challenging! I got my Bachelor degree in Finance and worked a lot for financial
                        institutions, opened my own business and tutored Hebrew.<br> However, I always knew there is something
                        else for me, something more artistic and creative, more fascinating.  When I got my first camera it
                        was the love from the first sigh. I love the photography and that vibe being behind the camera. 
                        Freeze the moment before it fades, capture that emotion you have here and now – that’s my behind
                        the camera mission – to give you these energies, so you can relive them forever!<br>
                        Nevertheless, the analytical side of me was a bit bored, so I kept looking . I was creating a 
                        <a style="color:#4d7992" href="https://ellendphoto.com/">website for my
                         photography business</a> and the process fascinated  and excite me so much that I decided to go deeper.
                        I found this whole world of creativity and logical connections, I found that logic could be very
                        creative and beautiful , that was the perfect combination of that I was looking for. So here I am,
                        exploring this amazing world of coding , tying my best and integrating this knowledge into my
                        updated life! Please enjoy browsing every single page of my coding word and feel free to contact me
