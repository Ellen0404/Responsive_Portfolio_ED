                                    in Italy and now living in the United States) I have lived in 3 different countries, dived into 3
                                    totally different cultures, and tried to get along with 3 different languages. Not easy, but always
                                    interesting and challenging! I got my Bachelor degree in Finance and worked a lot for financial
                                    institutions, opened my own business and tutored Hebrew.<br> However, I always knew there is something

                                    I found this whole world of creativity and logical connections, I found that logic could be very
